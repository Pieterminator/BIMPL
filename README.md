## LoLa

LoLa is a [Grammatical Framework](http://www.grammaticalframework.org/) (GF) application grammar for translating between first-order predicate logic (FOL) and natural language.
This is the code accompanying the [GEM @ EMNLP 2022](https://gem-benchmark.com/workshop) paper \[ADD PAPER\]


LoLa is an extension of [Ranta's (2011)](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~aarne/articles/cade2011.pdf) GF application.

The original version of Ranta's code is taken from [cade-2011](https://github.com/GrammaticalFramework/gf-contrib/tree/master/cade-2011). The file `Changes.md` lists all bug fixes and changes to the original code. The file `Experiment2.md` reports the steps taken for setting up the comparative human evaluation and analyzing the results.
