## BIMPL

BIMPL is a [Grammatical Framework](http://www.grammaticalframework.org/) (GF) application grammar for translating between first-order predicate logic (FOL) and natural language.

This is the code accompanying the AI bachelor's thesis "Exploring the bi-implication in logic-to-text translation: An endeavour to improve upon Ranta's rule-based approach" by Pieter van der Werff at Utrecht University.

To run the app, follow the instructions in the `README.md` in the `src` folder.
