## Grammatical Framework application grammar for translating between language and predicate logic

LoLa is an adaptation of Ranta's (2011) Grammatical Framework application:
_Translating between language and logic: what is easy and what is difficult._
A Ranta - International Conference on Automated Deduction, 2011, LNCS/LNAI. See http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~aarne/articles/cade2011.pdf.

The original version of Ranta's code is taken from [cade-2011](https://github.com/GrammaticalFramework/gf-contrib/tree/master/cade-2011). The file `Changes.md` lists all bug fixes and changes to the original code. The file `Experiment2.md` reports the steps taken for setting up experiment 2 (comparative translation quality assessment) and analyzing the results.

### Compile with stack

To build

    make pgf
    stack build

To test

    stack run trans "for all numbers x , x is even or x is odd"

For translating all sentences in a source language from an input text file to a target language with AST simplification, writing them to an output text file:

    stack run trans <source-language> <input-file> <target-language> <output-file>
