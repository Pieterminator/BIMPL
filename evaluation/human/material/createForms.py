We will present to you, one by one, 20 formulas with 3 candidate translations, like in the example below:\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFormula:\t\t\t¬¨ ‚àÉ x ( Cube ( x ) ‚àß LeftOf ( ùóï , x ) )\n\nTranslation 1:\t\tThere is no element x such that x is a cube and ùóï is to the left of x.\nTranslation 2:\t\tIt is not the case that there is an element x such that x is a cube and ùóï is to the left of x.\nTranslation 3:\t\tFor all cubes x, ùóï is not to the left of x or x is not even.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease rank the translations by the criterion of ùó≥ùóπùòÇùó≤ùóªùó∞ùòÜ, where rank 1 stands for the most fluent, and 3 for the least fluent translation. By a fluent translation, we mean a translation that sounds as a natural English sentence. In ranking, ties are allowed. So, for example, if you think Translation 1 is best and Translation 2 and 3 are equally bad, give Translation 1 the highest rank (1), and Translation 2 and 3 the next highest rank (2), assigning nothing to the third rank.\n\nIn ranking the translations, please note that it is very important that you evaluate the fluency of the translations based only on the form of the translations (not on their adequacy given the formula). It can happen that two candidate translations are exactly the same. Please assign them the same rank always.\n\nFor your information, these are the interpretations of the predicates used in the formulas:\nDodec ( x )\t\t\tx is a dodecahedron\nSmall ( x )\t\t\tx is small\nStudent ( x )\t\t\tx is a student\nMedium ( x )\t\tx is medium\nCube ( x )\t\t\tx is a cube\nPrime ( x )\t\t\tx is a prime\nPerson ( x )\t\t\tx is a person\nTet ( x )\t\t\t\tx is a tetrahedron\nPet ( x )\t\t\t\tx is a pet\nLarge ( x )\t\t\tx is large\nEven ( x )\t\t\tx is even\nAdjoins ( x , y )\t\tx is adjacent to y\nSameCol ( x , y )\t\tx is in the same column as y\nLeftOf ( x , y )\t\tx is to the left of y\nRightOf ( x , y )\t\tx is to the right of y\nSmaller ( x , y )\t\tx is smaller than y\nFrontOf ( x , y )\t\tx is in front of y\nLarger ( x , y )\t\tx is larger than y\nSameRow ( x , y )\tx is in the same row as y\nSameShape ( x , y )\tx is the same shape as y\nSameSize ( x , y )\tx is the same size as y\nBackOf ( x , y )\t\tx is in back of y");']
