10,10,RG,∃ x ( Large ( x ) → Small ( x ) ) ∨ ∃ y ( Tet ( y ) ∧ Tet ( y ) ),"there is an element x such that if x is large , then x is small or some tetrahedron is a tetrahedron",No,3,4,"If some element x is large, then x is small or some y is a tetrahedron"
11,11,RG,"∃ x ( FrontOf ( x , a ) ∨ Small ( a ) ) → ¬ Prime ( a )","if there is an element x such that x is in front of a or a is small , then a is not a prime",Yes,4,3,"If some x is in front of a, or a is small, then a is not a prime"
12,12,RG,¬ ( ∀ x Student ( a ) ∧ ¬ Small ( b ) ),"it is not the case that for all x , a is a student and b is not small",Yes,4,3,
13,13,RG,"∃ x ( LeftOf ( x , a ) ∧ SameShape ( b , x ) ) ∨ ∃ x ¬ Smaller ( x , x )",there is an element x such that x is to the left of a and b is of the same shape as x or there is an element x such that x is not smaller than x,Yes,2,2,"Some x is to the left of a and the same shape as b, or some x is not smaller than itself"
14,14,RG,"∀ x ( ¬ Larger ( x , x ) → ( Student ( a ) ∨ Cube ( a ) ) )","for all x , if x is not larger than x , then a is a student or a is a cube",Yes,4,3,"For all x's not larger than itself, a is a student or a cube"
15,15,RG,"¬ LeftOf ( a , a ) ∧ ( ∃ x Cube ( x ) → ∀ x Smaller ( x , b ) )","all these hold : \n\t• a is not to the left of a \n\t• if there is an element x such that x is a cube , then for all x , x is smaller than b",Yes,5,1,No a is to the left of itself and if some x is a cube then all x's are smaller than b
16,16,RG,"¬ ( Even ( a ) → Medium ( b ) ) ∨ ( ∀ x Even ( x ) ∧ ( SameSize ( a , a ) ∨ Cube ( c ) ) )","it is not the case that if a is even , then b is medium or all these hold : \n\t• for all x , x is even \n\t• a is of the same size as itself or c is a cube",Yes,5,1,It's not the case that if a is even then b is medium or all x's are even and a is the same size as itself or c is a cube
17,17,RG,"¬ ¬ BackOf ( a , a )",it is not the case that a is not in back of a,Yes,2,1,A is at the back of a
18,18,RG,∀ x ∀ y Dodec ( y ) ∨ ( ¬ Large ( a ) → ∀ y Large ( y ) ),"at least one of these holds : \n\t• for all x , for all y , y is a dodecahedron \n\t• if a is not large , then for all y , y is large",Yes,4,1,"For all x's and y's, all y's are dodecahedrons or if a isn't large all y's are large"
19,19,RG,"( ∃ x SameRow ( a , x ) ∧ ( Student ( a ) ∧ Even ( a ) ) ) → Prime ( a )","if there is an element x such that a is in the same row as x , a is a student and a is even , then a is a prime",Yes,4,2,"If some x is in the same row as a, while a is both a student and even, then a is a prime"
20,20,Filler,"¬ ∃ x ( SameShape ( a , b ) → SameRow ( c , c ) )",it is not the case that there is an element x such that a is in the same shape as b and c is in the same row as itself,No,2,2,There's no x for which if a is the same shape as b then c is in the same row as itself
21,21,Filler,∀ x ( Tet ( x ) ∨ Prime ( a ) ) ∨ ∃ x ( Person ( x ) → Student ( a ) ),"for all x , x is a tetrahedron or a is a prime or there is an element x such that a is a student",No,3,4,"Each x is a tetrahedron or a is a prime, or if some x is a person then a is a student"
22,22,Filler,"∃ x ∀ y Larger ( x , a ) ∧ ∀ y ¬ Pet ( b )","there is an element x such that for all y , x is larger than a and there is an element x such that for all y , b is not a pet",No,3,2,"for all y's, some x is larger than a or b is not a pet"
23,23,Filler,"∃ x ( ( ( SameShape ( x , a ) ∧ Tet ( x ) ) → Adjoins ( x , a ) )","for all x , if x is of the same shape as a, then x is adjacent to a",No,5,4,"There's an x for which, if it's a tetrahedron and the same shape as a, then it adjoins a"
24,24,Filler,"∃ x Cube ( x ) ( Person ( a ) → Adjoins ( x , a ) )",there is a cube such that a is a person or x is adjacent to a,No,1,1,I think we're missing some symbol between cube(x) and (person.. Though I may be wrong I'm not too fluent in first order logic
