10,10,RG,"Student ( a ) ∨ ( Medium ( b ) ∨ ∀ x SameSize ( x , x ) )","a is a student , b is medium or for all x , x is of the same size as itself",No,3,3,or a is a student or it is the case that either b is medium or every x is the same size as itself
11,11,RG,"∀ x ¬ ( LeftOf ( x , x ) → LeftOf ( a , b ) )","for all x , it is not the case that if x is to the left of itself , then a is to the left of b",Yes,4,4,
12,12,RG,"Adjoins ( a , b ) ∧ ( ( SameRow ( a , b ) ∧ Person ( b ) ) → ( Dodec ( c ) ∧ RightOf ( c , a ) ) )","all these hold : \n\t• a is adjacent to b \n\t• if a is in the same row as b and b is a person , then c is a dodecahedron and c is to the right of a",Yes,4,4,"all these hold :   • a is adjacent to b   • if a is in the same row as b and b is a person , then c is a dodecahedron is to the right of a"
13,13,RG,"∀ x RightOf ( a , a )","for all x , a is to the right of itself",Yes,4,4,(it just doesn't make sense)
14,14,RG,"∀ x ∀ x ∃ x SameSize ( x , a )","for all x , for all x , there is an element x such that x is of the same size as a",Yes,4,2,"(there is a double x, but not an a introduced?) every x has the same size as a"
15,15,RG,"∃ x ∀ x ¬ Larger ( x , x )","there is an element x such that for all x , x is not larger than x",Yes,5,4,for all x's it is not larger than itself
16,16,RG,"¬ ( Adjoins ( a , b ) → Adjoins ( a , c ) ) ∨ ¬ ( Student ( c ) ∧ Medium ( a ) )","it is not the case that if a is adjacent to b , then a is adjacent to c or it is not the case that c is a student and a is medium",Yes,5,5,
17,17,RG,Medium ( a ) ∨ ( ( Small ( b ) → Tet ( b ) ) → ¬ Person ( c ) ),"at least one of these holds : \n\t• a is medium \n\t• if if b is small , then b is a tetrahedron , then c is not a person",Yes,4,3,"at least one of these holds :   • a is medium   • if b is small , it is a tetrahedron , which means that c is not a person"
18,18,RG,"∀ x ∃ x SameSize ( x , a )","for all x , there is an element x such that x is of the same size as a",Yes,5,5,there is always an x that is the same size as a
19,19,RG,"( ∃ x FrontOf ( a , x ) → ( Large ( a ) ∧ SameSize ( a , b ) ) ) ∨ Smaller ( c , c )","at least one of these holds : \n\t• if there is an element x such that a is in front of x , then a is large and of the same size as b \n\t• c is smaller than itself",Yes,4,4,
20,20,Filler,"¬ ∃ x ( SameShape ( a , b ) → SameRow ( c , c ) )",it is not the case that there is an element x such that a is in the same shape as b and c is in the same row as itself,No,1,2,"there is no x for: if a has the same shape as b, then c would be in the same row as c"
21,21,Filler,∀ x ( Tet ( x ) ∨ Prime ( a ) ) ∨ ∃ x ( Person ( x ) → Student ( a ) ),"for all x , x is a tetrahedron or a is a prime or there is an element x such that a is a student",No,3,3,"for all x at least one of these hold: - x is a tetrehedron of a is a prime - there is an x such that if it is a person, a is a student"
22,22,Filler,"∃ x ∀ y Larger ( x , a ) ∧ ∀ y ¬ Pet ( b )","there is an element x such that for all y , x is larger than a and there is an element x such that for all y , b is not a pet",No,2,2,there is an x for every y where x is larger than a and (for all y) there is no pet b
23,23,Filler,"∃ x ( ( ( SameShape ( x , a ) ∧ Tet ( x ) ) → Adjoins ( x , a ) )","for all x , if x is of the same shape as a, then x is adjacent to a",No,5,5,"there is an x that when it is a tetrahedron and has the same shape as a, then it is adjacent to that a"
24,24,Filler,"∃ x Cube ( x ) ( Person ( a ) → Adjoins ( x , a ) )",there is a cube such that a is a person or x is adjacent to a,No,2,4,"there is an x that is a cube such that if a is a person, then x adjoins a"
