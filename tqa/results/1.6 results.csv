10,10,RG,"∀ x ( ( SameSize ( x , a ) ∧ FrontOf ( a , a ) ) ∨ ¬ Pet ( x ) )","for all x , at least one of these holds : \n\t• x is of the same size as a and a is in front of itself \n\t• x is not a pet",Yes,5,2,"Everything is either not a pet or the same size as a while a is in front of itself, or both."
11,11,RG,"∃ x ∀ y ( Pet ( y ) ∧ BackOf ( a , x ) )","there is an element x such that for all y , y is a pet and a is in back of x",Yes,4,2,"There is an element x such that everything is a pet, and a is behind x"
12,12,RG,"∃ x ( Cube ( a ) ∨ ∀ y FrontOf ( a , b ) )","there is an element x such that a is a cube or for all y , a is in front of b",No,2,2,"There is a situation in which a is a cube, or a is in front of everything, or both"
13,13,RG,"¬ ( ( BackOf ( a , a ) ∧ Medium ( b ) ) ∨ ( Medium ( c ) ∧ SameCol ( c , d ) ) )",it is not the case that at least one of these holds : \n\t• a is in back of itself and b is medium \n\t• c is medium and in the same column as d,Yes,5,2,
14,14,RG,"∃ x ( Student ( x ) → Even ( x ) ) → ∀ x ( Pet ( a ) ∨ SameCol ( x , x ) )","if there is an element x such that if x is a student , then x is even , then for all x , a is a pet or x is in the same column as itself",No,3,2,"If there is an even student, every x is either in the same column of itself, or a is a pet, or both."
15,15,RG,¬ ( ∀ x Prime ( a ) ∧ ∀ y Tet ( y ) ),"it is not the case that for all x , a is a prime and for all y , y is a tetrahedron",Yes,4,2,"There is a situation in which a is not prime or there exists something that is not a tetrahedron, or both"
16,16,RG,"( ∃ x Small ( a ) ∧ ∀ x Pet ( x ) ) ∨ ( ( SameRow ( b , c ) ∧ Cube ( a ) ) → ¬ Tet ( a ) )","at least one of these holds : \n\t• there is an element x such that a is small and for all x , x is a pet \n\t• if b is in the same row as c and a is a cube , then a is not a tetrahedron",Yes,5,3,"I'd change the first point to ""everything is a pet and there is a situation in which a is small"""
17,17,RG,∃ x ∃ x ¬ Prime ( x ),there is an element x such that there is an element x such that x is not a prime,Yes,4,1,There exists something that is not prime
18,18,RG,"¬ ¬ ( LeftOf ( a , b ) → Dodec ( b ) )","it is not the case that it is not the case that if a is to the left of b , then b is a dodecahedron",Yes,2,1,a being left of b implies that b is a dodecahedron
19,19,RG,"¬ ( ( FrontOf ( a , b ) ∨ BackOf ( c , b ) ) ∧ ( Prime ( b ) → Tet ( a ) ) )","it is not the case that all these hold : \n\t• a is in front of b or c is in back of b \n\t• if b is a prime , then a is a tetrahedron",Yes,2,1,
20,20,Filler,"¬ ∃ x ( SameShape ( a , b ) → SameRow ( c , c ) )",it is not the case that there is an element x such that a is in the same shape as b and c is in the same row as itself,No,3,2,There is no situation in which the fact that a and b are the same shape implies that c is in the same row as itself.
21,21,Filler,∀ x ( Tet ( x ) ∨ Prime ( a ) ) ∨ ∃ x ( Person ( x ) → Student ( a ) ),"for all x , x is a tetrahedron or a is a prime or there is an element x such that a is a student",No,4,3,
22,22,Filler,"∃ x ∀ y Larger ( x , a ) ∧ ∀ y ¬ Pet ( b )","there is an element x such that for all y , x is larger than a and there is an element x such that for all y , b is not a pet",No,2,2,there is an x larger than a and b is never a pet.
23,23,Filler,"∃ x ( ( ( SameShape ( x , a ) ∧ Tet ( x ) ) → Adjoins ( x , a ) )","for all x , if x is of the same shape as a, then x is adjacent to a",No,4,3,"There is an element x for which the fact that x is a tetrahedon of the same shape as a implies that it is adjacent to a.  Or  There is an element x that is either adjacent to a or not a tetrahedon of the same shape as a, or both. "
24,24,Filler,"∃ x Cube ( x ) ( Person ( a ) → Adjoins ( x , a ) )",there is a cube such that a is a person or x is adjacent to a,No,4,3,Doesn't look like a valid formula
